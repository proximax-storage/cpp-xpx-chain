# Running a Peer Node on Ubuntu 18.04 (LTS)

These instructions summarize the minimum number of steps to run a [peer node](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/node.html#id1)
and connect it to an existing network using the cpp-xpx-chain build.

## Prerequisites

* Have defined the network nemesis block. Follow [these instructions](RUNNETWOWORKLIN.md) to run a private network.
* Have cpp-xpx-chain compiled in the node. Follow [these instructions](BUILDING.md) to build cpp-xpx-chain.

## Replace the network configuration

NOTE: This step is only required when connecting a peer node to a network that is up and running.
If you have not launched a network yet, move directly to ["Edit the node properties"](#edit-node-properties).

1\. Download a copy of the following files and folders from the node that originated the network:

* ``cpp-xpx-chain/_build/resources/``
* ``cpp-xpx-chain/_build/seed``

2\. From the candidate peer node server, save the downloaded files in a new folder named ``network-config`` under the ``cpp-xpx-chain/_build`` directory.

3\. To add the network configuration to the peer node, run the following commands from the ``cpp-xpx-chain/_build`` directory.

```bash
mkdir data
cp -r network-config/seed/network-test/ data/
cp -r network-config/resources/ resources/
```

Edit the node properties
---

The files ``resources/config-node.properties`` and ``resources/config-user.properties`` define the node configuration. 
Learn more about each network property in [this guide](https://nemtech.github.io/guides/network/configuring-node-properties.html#properties).

1\. Open ``resources/config-node.properties`` and search the ``[localnode]`` section.
Then, edit the properties with the peer node details.

``` ini
[localnode]
host = <YOUR_NODE_IP>
friendlyName = myPeerNode
version = 0
roles = Peer
```

2\. Open ``resources/config-user.properties`` and replace ``bootPrivateKey`` with the node's private key.
The account used identifies the node within the network.

NOTE: You can generate new accounts with the command ./bin/catapult.tools.address -g 10 --network mijin-test.

## Enable harvesting

This step enables harvesting, which allows the node to produce new blocks.
At least a node of the network must have harvesting enabled in order to produce blocks.

NOTE: If you don't want to enable harvesting, move directly to [Add other peer nodes](#add-other-peer-nodes).
 
1\. Open the file ``resources/config-extensions-server.properties`` and enable the harvesting extension.

```ini
# p2p extensions
...
extension.harvesting = true
...
```

2\. Edit the file ``resources/config-harvesting.properties`` and replace ``harvestKey`` with the private key of an account.
This account must have at least ``resources/config-network.properties#minHarvesterBalance`` harvest mosaic units.

```ini
[harvesting]
harvestKey = 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
isAutoHarvestingEnabled = true
...
```

## Add other peer nodes

The file ``resources/peers-p2p.json`` should contain strong nodes to serve as beacons.
A random subset of beacons should be set in each node's peer file for best network performance.

1\. Open the file and replace the public key and host with the public key, host, and port of the node that originated the network.

```

{
    "_info": "this file contains a list of all trusted peers and can be shared",
    "knownPeers": [
    {
    "publicKey": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "endpoint": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 7900
    },
    "metadata": {
    "name": "peernode",
    "roles": "Peer"
    }
    }
    ]
   }
```

2\. If the network has more peer nodes, you can list them by adding new entries to the ``knownPeers`` array.

## Run the node

```ssh
cd bin
./sirius.bc
```

If this is the first node of the network, you should see in the terminal the peer node producing new blocks:

``` sh
2020-04-17 12:55:25.687924 0x00007f39d7a39700: <info> (src::ScheduledHarvesterTask.cpp@35) successfully harvested block

````

If you are connecting to an existent network, you should see the peer node synchronizing blocks:

``` sh
2020-04-17 08:19:18.798634 0x00007f71c5976700: <info> (chain::ChainSynchronizer.cpp@206) peer returned 42 blocks (heigh
ts 2 - 43)
````
