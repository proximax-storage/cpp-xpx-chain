# Developer Notes

This document is intended for developers interested in blockchain development.

## Hardware requirements

The scripts shared on this page have been tested on servers with the following minimum requirements.

* CPU: 2 cores or more
* Memory: 4GB or more
* HD: 20GB or more

Server requirements are network dependent.
For example, networks with higher throughput will likely have higher requirements.

Although you might be able to run the software in less powerful instances, you might encounter some issues while installing or running the node.

## Port requirements

The port ``7900`` is required by blockchain to communicate between nodes.
Make sure that the server's host is accessible from the internet and that the port is open and available.
